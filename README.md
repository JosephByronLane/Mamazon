This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 
## What is this?

Ok so, our teacher asked us to make a e-commerce webpage as one of their second homework of the class. So I decided to re-create the amazon storefront, but instead of Amazon its Mamazon. 

I got full marks, btw.

I even did the 404 page!
